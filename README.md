npm install

Start the development server

npm start

Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or the default port shown in your terminal).

📦 Environment Variables

If your app connects to APIs or a backend, include an .env.example like:

REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com

(Add others as needed.)

📊 How It Works

The dashboard fetches light status from an API.

Displays map or list of highway lights.
